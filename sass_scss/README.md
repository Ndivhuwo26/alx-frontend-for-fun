Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions. It helps organize and simplify CSS code, making it more maintainable and reusable. SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a syntax of Sass that is fully CSS-compatible, allowing for easier migration from standard CSS while still offering all the power of Sass.
